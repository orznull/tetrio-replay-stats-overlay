# TETR.IO Replay Stats Browser Sources

A quick thing I made for tetrio journey windflower. Drag in a tetrio replay and populate browser sources with stats from that replay.

## Dock Setup

Add the config window to the OBS as a custom browser dock through **Docks > Custom Browser Docks**.

Because this overlay communicates through browser local storage, you must have the config be a dock on your OBS. The links to the browser sources are just links, so you can generate them anywhere, but the file upload must occur on an OBS dock or browser.
